# OpenSeadragonViewer

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/openseadragon-react-viewer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/openseadragon-react-viewer)

![Image of OpenSeadragon React Viewer](https://i.imgur.com/6PbYcbE.jpg)

A React wrapper component around the OpenSeadragon viewer. Feed `OpenSeadragonViewer` a IIIF manifest URL, and it will render an OpenSeadragon viewer with:

- FontAwesome toolbar icons
- A tile source dropdown navigation menu
- Thumbnails navigation
- Download options
- Support for deep linking, and saving URL parameters

## Installation and usage

```
yarn add openseadragon-react-viewer

// And peer dependencies
yarn add @emotion/react openseadragon react-device-detect react-select
```

Then use it in your app:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { OpenSeadragonViewer } from "openseadragon-react-viewer"

const App = () => {
  // Provide either a local IIIF manifest object
  const manifest = MY_AWESOME_MANIFEST;

  // Or, provide a publicly accessible URL of a IIIF manifest
  const manifestUrl = "https://some-manifest-url-here.json";

  // Options to show/hide extra UI features in the viewer
  // height(in pixels) option is default to 800 for wide-screens and 500 for narrow-screens
  // All other options default to 'true'
  const options = {
    showDropdown: true,
    showThumbnails: false,
    showToolbar: true,
    deepLinking: true,
    height: 800,
  };

  // Pass through any OpenSeadragon config options you'd like to override
  const openSeadragonOptions = {
    gestureSettingsMouse: {
      scrollToZoom: true,
    }
  };

  // Customize which tool bar controls are displayed
  const toolBarOptions = {
    showZoom: true,
    showFullScreen: true,
    showDownload: true,
    showPreviousNext: true,
  };

  // Note: A local manifest will take precedence over manifestUrl if both props are supplied
  return (
    <OpenSeadragonViewer
      manifest={manifest}
      manifestUrl={manifestUrl}
      options,
      openSeadragonOptions, // Optional
      toolBarOptions // Optional
      />
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Cross-site Requests

** This info pulled from the [Diva.js](https://github.com/ddmal/diva.js) package**

You may receive an error that looks something like this:

```bash
XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://example.com/demo/imagefiles.json. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8000' is therefore not allowed access.
```

This is a security precaution that all browsers use to prevent cross-site request forgeries. If you receive this message it is because your `manifestUrl` prop and the server used to serve the OpenSeadragon React Viewer are not at the same server address.

To fix this you must ensure that the OpenSeadragon React Viewer host's React application, and the location pointed to by the `manifestUrl` prop are being served by the same server, or you must create an exception using the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header on your server to explicitly white-list the `manifestUrl` location.
